 A protocol for filtering values in node observation.

 Filters allow you to control which values trigger change notifications by implementing
 custom filtering logic. The filter's `send` method is called with each new value and
 can decide whether to pass it through or suppress the notification.

/**
 A filter that only passes through values that are different from the previous value.

 This filter uses equality comparison to suppress duplicate onChange handler calls,
 which is useful for avoiding unnecessary work when the actual value hasn't changed.

 Note: This only affects onChange handler calls. SwiftUI and other Observation
 consumers will still receive notifications when the node becomes potentially dirty,
 allowing them to check for updates. This is the correct behavior because:
 - SwiftUI needs to know a value *might* have changed to trigger re-evaluation
 - onChange handlers should only run when values *actually* changed

 ```swift
 withGraphTracking {
   withGraphTrackingMap(
     { node.wrappedValue },
     filter: DistinctFilter<String>()
   ) { value in
     // Only called when value actually changes
     print("New value: \(value)")
   }
 }
 ```

 Note: When using `withGraphTrackingMap` with `Equatable` types, `DistinctFilter`
 is automatically applied, so you typically don't need to specify it explicitly.
